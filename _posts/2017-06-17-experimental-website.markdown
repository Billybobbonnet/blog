In early February, I had 2 weeks of free time between 2 contracts. No personnal project to finish, nothing ongoing, I was free. And that's a rare thing (maybe a first).

I planned to invest it into learning something new. And {% include altion.html  type="audio" audio="/assets/sounds/jaws.mp3" anchor="I had no idea about what was about to happen" %}.

It first started like "Hey, let's make a placeholder for my company URL!" and ended up in sweat after a two week long coding spree.

I went a little berserk but it was plain fun, and now I have something uncommon on the web to show.

Why is it an uncommon website? Well, for several reasons:

  * I wanted to review my basics. So no JS library allowed. No CSS I wouldn't write except `normalize.css`.

  * Any idea I had that would seem to make it more extraordinary had to be coded

  * In terms of technique, I wanted to use as many as I could.

The rationale? It would be "*Let's get better, and worst case scenario will be a pointless thing online that shows I can use many techniques in Web Developement. Better than a static placeholder.*".

Well, it certainly may be pointless, But I'm happy with it. I overcame <!--more-->all the hardships I had to make ideas real and the final product works.

I like using nice artworks but designing them is not innate for me. So the main challenge was to make it sweet to the eye. On this matter, it ended up being "ok" by my standards but it was not easy to get there.

This post purpose is to introduce several other posts, each explaining one of the techniques I used on this experiment (amongst others) and why I used them.

As I write them, I will link the related features to their posts.

Here are the upcoming recipes :

- Make my logo eyes follow the mouse pointer

- Homemade JS animation "engine"? Challenge accepted!

- Avoid collisions using a zone based exploration algorithm

- How I made a Javascript dialog engine

- Shortest path, not really, but "let's go home algorithm" certainly

- Sprites and canvas : let's kill this damn UFO

- Animations are fine, but let's make a bit of storytelling too!

- The Neatastic Console Show

- Finals thoughts about these experimental website

I'm a little fish in the big wild world pond but I want to play the game and get a feedback about what I do. I love learning how to do things better and this should certainly be a good way to achieve that.

So, you are **much welcome** to give me your input: comment the posts, question my choices, leave a kind word, give me advices, push updates on the experiment website repo or offer me to work on your cool and wealthy project! :construction_worker_man:

With :heart:,
