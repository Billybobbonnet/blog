Here we are! This is my first post!

It might be Neatastic blog, but right now, Neatastic is me : [Antoine Cordelois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-cordelois/){:target="_blank"}.

I am a UX researcher who decided to cultivate his other skill set : software and web developement, mostly web nowadays.

For four years now, I have been working as a freelance full stack developer.

I wanted to create a public face for my company but I never could find the time to make it. Here it is now, up there, that lovely three eyed dude.

Later, I will also add a portfolio and a conceptual website to the mix.

I usually try to publish everything that I code on my [Github](https://github.com/Billybobbonnet){:target="_blank"}, as long as my clients allow it. But sometimes, the journey is more fun than the destination, so I decided to make this blog to tell you about these experiments I made, these techniques I found, and brag a little about my new projects too :smiley:.

Since I made a ["sticky" feature](:sticky), this post will stay on top of the other posts until it is replaced by another more recent sticky one.

With :heart:,

Antoine
