Here we are! this is my first post! I am still coding that blog tho.

Since I made a "sticky" feature, it will stay  <!--more--> on top of other posts until it is replaced by another more recent sticky post (see the "Editorial" ribbon on top right of this post).

It might be Neatastic blog, but right now, Neatastic is me: **Antoine Cordelois**. I am a former UX researcher who decided to cultivate his other skill set: software and web developement, mostly web nowadays.

For four years now, I have been working as a freelance full stack developer.

I wanted to create a public face for my company but I never could find the time to make it. Here it is now, up there, that lovely three eyed dude.

I try to publish everything that I code on Github, as long as the clients allow it. But sometimes, the journey is more fun than the destination, so I decided to make a blog to tell you about this experiements I made, the techniques I found, and brag about my new projects.
