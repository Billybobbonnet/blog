Here we are! This is my first post!

It might be Neatastic blog, but right now, Neatastic is me : [Antoine Cordelois](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoine-cordelois/){:target="_blank"}.

I am an UX researcher who decided to cultivate his other skill set : software and web developement, mostly web nowadays.

For four years now, I have been working as a freelance full stack developer.

I wanted to create a public face for my company but I never could find the time to make it. Here it is now, up there, that lovely three eyed dude.

Later, I will also add a portfolio and a conceptual website to the mix.

I usually try to publish everything that I code on my [Github](https://github.com/Billybobbonnet){:target="_blank"}, as long as my clients allow it.

But sometimes, the journey is funnier than the destination, so I decided to make this blog to tell you about these experiments I made, these techniques I found, and maybe brag a little about my new projects too :smiley:. And that's my UX playground too.

I will try to have a different stance than most developement articles authors : they are factual, cold you could say, often present only the end result explanation, and they often write on a very formal tone.

While I enjoy this kind of readings for its clarity, I want to do the opposite (remaining clear, hopefully).

I will focus on *how* a feature is born, *what* was the process, *why* I made it, and use a lighter tone. Feel free to comment about that.

With :heart:,

Antoine

ps: Since I made a ["sticky" feature](/2017/05/31/sticky-posts.html), this post will stay on top of the other posts until it is replaced by another more recent sticky one.
